####Question 1
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Flipper Length vs. Bill Length by Penguin Species",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)", y = "Flipper Length (mm)") +
  theme_minimal()

ggsave("penguin_scatterplot.png")

```

####Question 2

```{r}
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility

random_sample = rnorm(10)
logical_vector = random_sample > 0
character_vector = as.character(1:10)
factor_vector = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), length.out = 10))

df = data.frame(random_sample, logical_vector, character_vector, factor_vector)
print(df)

library(tidyverse)
mean(df$random_sample)        # Works
mean(df$logical_vector)       # Works (TRUE is 1, FALSE is 0)
mean(df$character_vector)   # Doesn't work
mean(df$factor_vector)      # Doesn't work

as.numeric(df$logical_vector)      # Converts TRUE to 1, FALSE to 0
as.numeric(df$character_vector)    # Returns NA with a warning
as.numeric(df$factor_vector)       # Converts factor levels to their underlying numeric codes

```



The `penguins` dataset contains `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns. Some important variables include species (Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo), flipper_length_mm, and bill_length_mm. The mean flipper length is `r mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)` mm.
